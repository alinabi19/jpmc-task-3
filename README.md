Problem:\
Not giving much information between the stocks..

\
Tasks:\
(1) We want to make this graph more useful to traders by making it track the ratio between two stocks over time and NOT the two stocksâ€™ top_ask_price.\
(2) Traders want to monitor the ratio of two stocks against a historical correlation with upper and lower bounds. This can help them determine a trading opportunity. Therefore we also want to make this graph plot the upper and lower bounds and show when they get crossed.

\
End Result:
